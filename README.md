All the programs are executed successfully
ignore all the warnings for program 9 [ warning - implicit deleration of functions ]
In C, a function must be declared before it is used to specify its return type, arguments, and number of arguments. If a function is not declared before use, the compiler assumes the return type to be "int" by default, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors during runtime , but this program should execute fine with all the implicit decleraion warnings , I will try to fix it when i'm free.
